# Genome analysis of *Pterois miles* - UNDER CONSTRUCTION
This repository contains scripts and implementations that have been developed during my master thesis on the genome analysis of devil firefish *Pterois miles*. Analysis consists of *de novo* construction of genome assembly, genome annotation (transposable elements, gene prediction, functional), phylogenomic tree inferrence and comparative studies. Scripts and workflows for each step are provided in their corresponding folders.
