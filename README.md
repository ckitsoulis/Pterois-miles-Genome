# Genome analysis of *Pterois miles*
This repository contains scripts and implementations that have been developed during my master thesis on the genome analysis of species *Pterois miles*. Analysis consists of *de novo* genome assembly, genome annotation (transposable elements, gene prediction) and functional annotation. Scripts and workflows for each step are provided in the corresponding folders.
