# Transposable Elements annotation pipeline

For the transposable elements annotation of the genome assembly, a custom pipeline was used (see *image* below), based on state-of-the-art tools publicly available. Filtering and correction steps between tools were processed with custom python and bash scripts.

These tools are:

1. [RepeatModeler](https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatModeler)
2. [EDTA](https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA)
3. [DeepTE](https://github.com/LiLabAtVT/DeepTE)
4. [RepeatMasker](http://www.repeatmasker.org)

## Installation
All tools were run in conda environment and the installation instructions for each tool and their dependencies are provided in the corresponding repositories.

## Usage
All commands are provided in a pre-defined order (non-automatic usage for now) in the file *"TE_Annotation_workflow.sh"*.
